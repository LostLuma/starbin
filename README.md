# Starbin

A hastebin-compatible paste site running on Cloudflare Workers / Pages.

# Deployment

To deploy as a Pages project you will need to follow these steps:

- Fork this repo to an account where you can install GitHub Apps
- Create an empty KV namespace to store pastes in on the Workers dashboard
- Create a new Pages project using the Git integration and your forked repo
  - Set an empty `echo` command as the build command - no actual build is performed
  - Set the build output directory to `/static/` to allow Pages to find the website
- Under the project's settings in the Functions tab set up a new KV namespace binding
  - Set the variable name to `STORAGE`, the namespace to the namespace from earlier
- Under the project's Environment Variables settings set up the following variables:
  - `DOCUMENT_KEY_SIZE`: Number of digits to use for document URLs
  - `MAX_DOCUMENT_SIZE`: Maximum number of characters allowed per paste
  - `DOCUMENT_EXPIRE_TTL`: Number of seconds until documents expire
  - `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` : (Optional) Maximum number of creation requests per minute

And that's it! You may now set a custom domain if you'd like the site to be available outside of workers.dev

# TODO

I did not invest any time into creating my own frontend yet, all static
assets are copied from the original [haste-server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server).
